# About 

Houser is my final college project, inspirated by Friday, Iron Man's AI from the Marvel movies, but with another vision, here she have the objective to control somethings inside your house, to make the things easyer and safer for you, using voice recognition she is able to recognize the person that is talking with she and than create some patterns to make your "home life" easyer.
